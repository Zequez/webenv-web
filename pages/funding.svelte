  <h1>Funding</h1>

  <p>
    In order to take the Web Environment into it's full potential I'll need
    months of consistent work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I intend to do this while feeding myself with food that nourishes me, and
    while attending trainings and doing experiments for expanding my box and
    unleashing even more energy and clarity to pour into the creative endevour.
    And while I enjoy a post-apocaliptic survival adventure, I would rather be a
    well-fed artist than a starving one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not asking for money and hoping it all works, while very instructional, has
    not worked very well for the purpose of nourishing me on every level. So
    <a href="https://gobeepshiftgo.mystrikingly.com/" target="_blank"
      >beep, shift, go</a
    >; I'm trying something different.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary strategy is to reach out to NLNet and spread out from there.
    Additionally there might be crowd-funding available from the PM community if
    I can demostrate that the Web Environment can be used to steward the
    underlying system for Startover's 700 websites that are currently held
    hostage (alright I'm dramatizing) at MyStrikingly walled garden platform.

  <blockquote>
    If this does not work, I'll find a odd jobs on the open source projects
    network from NLNet where I can put the Web Environment to use.

  <h2>A Case for Grant Funding</h2>

  <p>
    According the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund/guideforapplicants/"
      >NLNet Guide for Applications</a
    > the criteria is:
  </p>

  <p>30% - Technical excellence/feasibility</p>
  <p>40% - Relevance/Impact/Strategic potential</p>
  <p>30% - Cost effectiveness/Value for money</p>
