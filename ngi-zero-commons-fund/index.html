technology for building web-technology-based software.

Every new project built within the environment starts with a single empty folder, which
gets initialized with GIT for version control.

There is an UI for managing multiple repositories.
- Starting/Stopping active (development mode) servers
- Bundling and publishing to the web
- Committing and version control
- (in the future, making changes-proposals (pull-requests), to repos from other participants)

Additionally, the coding environment UI, includes the tools to self-edit the code environment,
add commits, and contribute back to the source.

A project can be as simple as a single App.svelte file, which has access to the whole
curated library from the coding environment:
- Libraries for building P2P software
- Libraries for creating Canvas-based software
- Libraries for creating toroidal-navigation websites
- Libraries for creating games
- Libraries for coding educacion
- Libraries for working with AI
- Libraries for UI elements
- Collections of resources such as SVG shapes or bitmap textures for crafting interfaces

At the moment there is a single driver for building, which is a Vite driver, with UnoCSS with Tailwind presets,
image optimization processing, Svelte. Each repo selects the driver used.

There is also the publishing driver, that right now it's designed for creating a single www branch
and publishing to the origin GIT server, in this case, using Github Pages infrastructure.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">1563/1200</div></pre><!----> <div class="text-center">Attempt 2</div> <div class="mx6 bg-black/10 px6 py3 rounded-t-2">(You have 1200 characters)</div> <pre class="b b-black/20 rounded-2 p6 mb6 relative whitespace-pre-wrap">The Web Environment it's a key technical component of a larger plan to put the power of self-soverign
technological infrastructure in the hands of independently organized individuals and communities.

The Web Environment is not an app, but a curated coding environment designed with an integrated UI
in order to progressively reduce the technical barrier needed to steward a collaborative open source codebase.

It works like a monorepo, where the SubRepos are individuals projects, and the parent repository handles
the curation of Libraries, Substrates and Drivers.

The environment includes:

- UI for managing SubRepos
- Substrates libraries for creating kinds-of-screen-based-experiences
- Curated Libraries from NPM, accessible as imports directly for all SubRepos and some pre-configured with Drivers
- Drivers for things such as running, building, publishing
- Coding tools

A key part of the project is that, being a coding environment, it's not distributed as an app, but
as a raw repository, with instructions to set it up. Additionally, there is an integrated UI
for managing the GIT repo of the Web Environment without the CLI.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">1140/1200</div></pre><!----> <p>Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this
    project before?

(max 2500 characters)</div> <pre class="b b-black/20 rounded-2 p6 mb6 relative whitespace-pre-wrap">In the past I joined LightningRod Labs that's a team creating The Weave on Holochain and worked with them
in creating the weave-dev-context, a kind of precursor of the web-environment.

And also The Web Substrate and the Gamez UI, whose learnings were distilled in what now I'm calling the canvas-substrate
within the Web Environment.

Before LrL I worked on web-technology from the age of 13 when I first learned how
to make websites. My work has been wide in a variety of web fields. I've worked within
software-factory teams Avalith, Willdom, BandOfCoders; and funnelled from there I also had
a short experience working within a corporate structure at Piksel.

I've worked with Wube Software, the creators of Factorio, at the initial stages of the web portal.

I've worked extensively within Ubiquity DAO stewarding the development environment for the
smart contracts and web UI, and crafting the web UI.

And I have a long list of Github projects each with their own deveploment environment.

Over the years I've accrued extensive knowledge in crafting empowering development environments.

I intend to share this knowledge and lower the bar to collaborating in creating software so that
individuals and communities can take responsibity for having a self-soverign digital infrastructure.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">1292/2500</div></pre><!----> <div class="bg-main-400 rounded-2 font-bold mb6 text-shadow-[0_1px_0_#0006] text-white lh-12 px6 shadow-[0_2px_0] shadow-main-300">Requested Support</div><!----> <pre>Requested <strong>Amount:</strong> EUR 12,000

    project have other funding sources, both past and present? A breakdown in the
    main tasks with associated effort is appreciated. Make rates explicit. (If you
    want, you can in addition attach a full budget at the bottom of the form)</p> <div class="mx6 bg-black/10 px6 py3 rounded-t-2">Explain costs for hardware, human labor (including rates used), travel cost

When I see you ask about rates used I'm afraid because I have not been tracking my time working
on the Web Environment. While I understand the need to box a specific timespan for the purpose of accountability,
in reality even leisure time can be considered, indirectly, related to the desired creative end result.

In my last work agreement, I was being paid US$45 by the hour,
and I tracked all the tasks I worked on on a that I tracked
on a Google Sheets. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MeMrlM70ICYMXkiaU9J52j1oaNMP7dc3WBPBxx7ha50/edit?usp=sharing)

Historically I usually do not reach more than 20hs of sitting-coding-time per week
on any project, as I prefer to spend more active time with my, currently 4 years old son.

Aside from the cost of covering my physical material human needs, I don't see any other use of the funds.
I code on my personal laptop, and I intend to use my own personal funds at my own discretion if I need
new hardware, traveling or training. And for that purpose EUR 2000 is sufficient.

If needs to be, I would say EUR 40 would be the rate I would pick for myself, for sitting-coding-time; not
including communication time or even writing. I'm willing to track the tasks and get feedback.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">1331/2500</div></pre><!----> <p><strong>Compare</strong> your own project with existing or historical efforts.</p> <div class="mx6 bg-black/10 px6 py3 rounded-t-2">E.g. what is new, more thorough or otherwise different. (max 4000 characters, be concise)</div> <pre class="b b-black/20 rounded-2 p6 mb6 relative whitespace-pre-wrap">- The project self-references it's own repository management on the UI level so that it does not have
a "development" and "production" version; and every "user" has exactly the same code as each "developer";
shifting the paradigm to that of being a steward of a codebase, rather than the owner.
- Every SubRepo is intentionally within the same environment, enabling cross-referencing other repositories
on the type level as long as there is an agreement of names.
- Intentionally designed so that each more-technically-inclined steward facilitates the
coding environment to their circle.
- This makes explicit the trust implicit in using software made by someone else, even when open source.
- It's also resilient; if a steward steps down for any reason, the people who subscribe to
their repo just need to change the origin to keep getting updates.
- Establishes a radically horizontal cooperative coding environment where there is truly no "official" version,
just one for each steward
- Like a framework it provides a toolbox of utilities to craft software; unlike most frameworks, it's not merely
a CLI and library tool, it's a UI-based tool. And as part of the framework it includes multi-project-management.
- Once set up it runs locally on your computer and what you create is meant to be used locally as an app without
any kind of bundling or deployment; directly from source. Much like a sandbox environment. While simultaneously
providing tools for projecting to the web.
- When running locally the environment provides a server for accessing system functions in order to
adopt a coding paradigm of code as data; Substrates can self-update the SubRepo codebase from their
web UI for persistance, rather than use a separte database. Web projections, get a static non-editable
version of the substrates.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">1811/4000</div></pre><!----> <p>What are significant technical <strong>challenges</strong> you expect to solve

to easily create independent self-wrapped apps for each SubRepo.
- Make the Web Environment accessible for mobile participants. As it does not rely on IPC, it is
possible right now to access the Web Env from phones in local networks. It might be possible to improve this.
- Making a collaborative Forking / Merging system that is accessible to non-technical people; a way to
truly allow multiple people to edit a single repo effectively.
- Adding real-time cooperative editing of repos
- Integrating decentralized tools access such as Holochain, Nostr or Solid.
- Making GIT credentials system and security somehow accessible to non-technical people and also secure. Using OS keyrings to store Git deploy keys.
Maybe experiment with shared facilitated accounts that only serve as a backend for the SubRepos.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">866/5000</div></pre><!----> <p>Describe the <strong>ecosystem</strong> of the project, and how you will engage

open source collaborative software. We are inviting neighbours to get involved and setting up money-flows
to evolve the development of a neighbourhood digital infrastructure.

Additionally, on the regional level, I'm connecting with agroecologic producers and farmers to also
write cooperative software for them so they can have a single platform from where to collect and share
all their Game Field information..

I'm setting up people with the Web Environment so they can steward their personal websites as
open source software. I'm setting up groups of people so they can steward their project website
and tools.

I'm replacing myself by training and collaborating with others who can steward their own
Web Environment repository and be the origin for people they faciltiate open source software to.<div class="absolute bottom-0 right-1.5 opacity-50 text-3 lh-6">910/2500</div></pre><!----> <div class="bg-main-400 rounded-2 font-bold mb6 text-shadow-[0_1px_0_#0006] text-white lh-12 px6 shadow-[0_2px_0] shadow-main-300">Attachments</div><!----> <div class="bg-black/10 rounded-2 p6 mb6">Attachments: add any additional information about the project that may help

    to pick 5 that resonate with the Web Environment then contact the stewards
    and ask for feedback. On a separate spreadsheet I'm tracking down who to
